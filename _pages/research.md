# Current Research Experience

I am currently a Bioinformatics PhD Candidate mentored by Drs. Cristen Willer and Mike Boehnke. I work with both research groups to study the genetics of complex diseases, specifically cardiovascular and metabolic traits, using computational and statistical methods.

## Cristen Willer Group
*University of Michigan*  
*Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Human Genetics, and Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics*  

## Michael Boehnke/Laura Scott Group
*University of Michigan*  
*Department of Biostatistics, Center for Statistical Genetics*  

# Former Research Experience 

## David Ginsburg Lab
*University of Michigan*    
*Department of Human Genetics, Life Sciences Institute*    
As a rotation student I used bacteriophage display and high throughput sequencing to explore hemostatic protease biochemistry.

## Francis Collins Laboratory
*National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute*  
*Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch*    
I worked as a Postbaccalaureate IRTA trainee in the Collins Group in the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Parker, and used my bioinformatics skill set to perform integrative analyses using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, genotypes, and chromatin state data to identify regions involved in Type 2 Diabetes susceptibility. The Collins lab is particularly interested in non-coding regions where the majority of Genome Wide Association Study loci for T2D and related traits are located. Other NHGRI researchers and I were also highlighed by [LabTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ieJsPz1hc) in their effort to encourage high sschool and undergraduate students to explore careers in biomedical research.

## Corbin Jones Laboratory
*University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
Biology Department*  
I worked as a high school volunteer, and later, an undergraduate research assistant in the Corbin Jones Lab from summer 2008 until my graduation from UNC-CH in May 2013. My undergraduate research experience includes a co-authored publication, Mechanosensation across and within Drosophila species. In addition, I conducted research for my honors thesis, “Evolutionary Development of Gain-of-Function Stripes in Z. indianus,” in the Jones lab.
