I am currently pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics and Master of Arts in Statistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and Genome Sciences Predoctoral Trainee. I am excited about the future for human genomics and genetics in the new age of high-throughput sequencing, big data, and the $1,000 genome. My career goal is to work in a collaborative research environment combining quantitative genomics, computational biology, and clinical application to fulfill the promise of Precision Medicine. I spent two years as a postbaccalaureate intramural research trainee in the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. I am a native of North Carolina and a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I graduated in May 2013 with a Bachelors of Science in Quantitative Biology as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa National Honor Society, having earned highest honors and highest distinction. I pursued challenges outside of the classroom, and my extracurricular activities, leadership experiences, community service, and research opportunities have inspired and shaped my career goals.
