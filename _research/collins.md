## [Francis Collins Laboratory](https://www.genome.gov/27534095/collins--group/)  
August 2013 - August 2015  
*National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute*  
*Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch*    
I worked as a Postbaccalaureate IRTA trainee in the Collins Group in the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Parker, and used my bioinformatics skill set to perform integrative analyses using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, genotypes, and chromatin state data to identify regions involved in Type 2 Diabetes susceptibility. The Collins lab is particularly interested in non-coding regions where the majority of Genome Wide Association Study loci for T2D and related traits are located. Other NHGRI researchers and I were also highlighed by [**LabTV**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ieJsPz1hc) in their effort to encourage high sschool and undergraduate students to explore careers in biomedical research.
