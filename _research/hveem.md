As a [postdoctoral fellow](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/brookewo) in the HUNT Center for Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology (formerly the K.G. Jebsen Center for Genetic Epidemiology), I am performing research under the mentorship of [Professor Kristian Hveem](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.hveem). Beginning in 2021 I am a funded by the [INTERVENE project](https://www.interveneproject.eu). This is an international effort funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme to harmonize and utilize biobanks to prevent common diseases. I began my Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in January 2024. This launched my ProtectHearts project aiming to identify proteomic predictors of heart disease, especially for women and the young.
