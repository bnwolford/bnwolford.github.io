As a [postdoctoral fellow](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/brookewo) in the HUNT Center for Clinical and Molecular Epidemiology (formerly the K.G. Jebsen Center for Genetic Epidemiology), I am performing research under the mentorship of [Professor Kristian Hveem](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.hveem). Beginning in 2021 I am a funded by the [INTERVENE project](https://www.interveneproject.eu). This is an international effort funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme to harmonize and utilize biobanks to prevent common diseases. I began my Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in January 2024. This launched my ProtectHearts project aiming to identify proteomic predictors of heart disease, especially for women and the young. 

The HUNT Center for Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology (MCE) is a research group at the interface of epidemiological studies, genetic epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and clinical translation. We study individuals' biological conditions, lifestyle and environment that can lead to health and illness, using population studies. Within this group, I carry out a research program focused on precision public health. Through supervising students and my work with the EU-funded INTERVENE consortium and Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ProtectHearts project, I aim to bring genetic and proteomic biomarkers to screening and prevention programs. My main focus is on developing precision medicine approaches to prevent heart disease using population biobanks. My students and I also aim to better model risk factors for dementia, type 2 diabetes, and breast cancer.
