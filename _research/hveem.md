As a postdoctoral fellow in the [K.G. Jebsen Centre for Genetic Epidemiology](https://www.ntnu.edu/huntgenes/k.g.-jebsen-center-for-genetic-epidemiology), I am performing research under the mentorship of Center Leader, [Dr. Kristian Hveem](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.hveem), as part of the [INTERVENE project](https://www.interveneproject.eu). This is an international effort funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme to harmonize and utilize biobanks to prevent common diseases.
