I worked as a high school volunteer, and later, an undergraduate research assistant in the Corbin Jones Lab from summer 2008 until my graduation from UNC-CH in May 2013. My undergraduate research experience includes a co-authored publication, Mechanosensation across and within Drosophila species. In addition, I conducted research for my honors thesis, “Evolutionary Development of Gain-of-Function Stripes in Z. indianus,” in the Jones lab.
