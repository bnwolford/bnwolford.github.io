I joined the lab of [[**Dr. Cristen Willer**]](http://www.umich.edu/~willerim/) as a rotation student in May 2016. Since September 2016 I have been performing dissertatiton work in the Willer lab. Broadly, I study the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. My research projects range from the study of Mendelian disease in Thoracic Aortic Dissection patients from the University of Michigan [**Cardiac Health Improvement Project**](https://www.umcvc.org/cardiovascular-health-improvement-project-chip-study) to the study of polygenic diseases in large population scale biobanks such as the [**Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Health Study**](https://www.ntnu.edu/hunt) and the [**UK Biobank**](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). I am interested in contributing to the development of precision health strategies by developing and employing computational tools to analyze big data in the form of EHR-linked biobanks with genetic data.
