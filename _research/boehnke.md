## Michael Boehnke/Laura Scott Group
May 2016 - Present  
*University of Michigan*  
*Department of Biostatistics, Center for Statistical Genetics*  

I am currently a Bioinformatics PhD Candidate mentored by [Dr. Cristen Willer](http://www.umich.edu/~willerim/index.html) and [Dr. Mike Boehnke](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/boehnke-michael.html). I work with both research groups to study the genetics of complex diseases, specifically cardiovascular and metabolic traits, using computational and statistical methods.
