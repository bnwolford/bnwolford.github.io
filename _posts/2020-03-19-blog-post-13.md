It's been over a week since widespread closures began in my area, Ann Arbor, Michigan. It's been 8 days since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. I'm continuing to curate the top science news and resources here on the blog. You can see my first few days of updates [here](http://www.brookewolford.com/posts/2020/03/blog-post-12/). I'm trying to add explainers for non-scientists and adding *my* take on the significance of findings when possible. As with anything on the internet, readers should take my editorializations with an ounce of skepticism. What started as advocating for a few weeks of social distancing, now looks more like an effort to present relevant science as humanity battles a potentially long-lasting pandemic. I hope it helps in some way.

## March 19, 2020 Update

* CDC released their [Morality and Morbidity Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm) on March 18 showing an initial look at U.S. COVID-19 outcomes. Highlights:
  - "These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19." 
  - 20% of hospitalizations were of persons aged 20-44 years, proving the young are not as invincible as they might believe.  This is where I'd like to reiterate to milliennials and Gen Z-ers still continuing to have unnecessary social contatcts: **we're all in this together, so act like it.**

* A scientist from Seattle has a [Twitter thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/trvrb/status/1240444821593944064) outlining an approach to combat the U.S. epidemic that may shorten the 18 month time frame now being reported. It starts with a huge roll out of testing to stop the spread that is occurring before symptoms begin. This would be supported with contact tracing by cell-phone location. Serologocial assays could be used to identify who has recovered from COVID-19 and therefore are likely to possess ongoing immunity. Those individuals with confirmed immunity could the keep economies, companies, and hospitals running. Of the many innovative ideas people are considering, it will be interesting to see what policies actually make it to implementation.

* Scientific pre-prints are bringing valauable information to a global force of scientists, policy makers, and informed citizens. These publications pass initial screenings by pre-print servers but are not peer-reviewed by scientists, an important step to publishing in a respected academic research journal. In other words, they should not be trusted explicitly, but often hold imporant information. A recent pre-print by Jiao Zhao et al showed that **individuals of the A blood group may be at higher risk of COVID-19 when compared to the AB, B, and O groups combined**. The odds ratio is 1.21 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.02,1.43). This would mean the odds of COVID-19 are 21% greater in the A blood group compared to the reference group, which in this case is all other blood types. Due to a small-ish sample size of 1,775, some statisticians might say this estimate has a rather large confidence interval. This means we are 95% sure the *truth* is acually that the odds are anywhere from 2% to 43% greater for A blood group individuals. Note, [oddsâ‰ probabilty](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-you-mixing-up-odds-with-probability-5f2d385fa890). Conversely, **individuals of the O blood group may be at higher risk when compared to A, AB, and B groups combined**. The odds ratio is 0.67 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.60-0.75. This means the odds of COVID-19 are 33% less in the O blood group compared to those of other groups.  More studies are needed to confirm this in other populations and in a larger sample size, but it could inform clinical guidelines or prioritizaiton of personal protective equipment (PPE) amidst scarcity use for health care workers. **We are all still at risk of COVID, so this should not change individual behaviors regardless of blood type.**

* A Chinese charitable organization, Jack Ma Foundation, and the philanthrophic arm of the Alibaba Group released a [handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment](https://covid-19.alibabacloud.com) aimed at health care workers.

* The director of the National Institute of Mental Health relesaed a [statement on coping with coronavirus](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/messages/2020/coping-with-coronavirus-managing-stress-fear-and-anxiety.shtml). Here is a collection of **mental health resources** I've seen shared:
