I had the honor of being  guest on the Perspective 2020 podcast hosted by my former UNC classmate Kara Marker Credle back in December 2020. We discussed living in a data driven world, both in general and during a pandemic. 

Our conversation is out as the February episode. Listen on Spotify/Apple or on Perspective 2020 Pod <a href="https://perspective2020pod.com/interpreting-a-data-driven-world/">"website"</a>.
