Hei fra Trondheim! 

Having played sports from a young age, I love being on a team. I am motivated by the camaraderie, collaboration, and unity towards a common goal. I like to think this is why I've ended up in a research area where team science is the norm. Luckily, my team spans the Atlantic Ocean and I'm currently in Trondheim, Norway!

I've been working with collaborators at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) for several weeks now. Even though I speak less Norwegian than a toddler, I was able to help out with some science communication on the NTNU Faculty of Medicine's English blog. [Here]( https://blog.medisin.ntnu.no/using-hunt-to-study-disease-causing-genetic-variation/) I describe the collaborative project between University of Michigan and NTNU.
