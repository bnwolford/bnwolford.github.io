Following last yearâ€™s American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) conference in Vancouver I applied for and was selected to write for the ASHG trainee newsletter, The Nascent Transcript. My first piece, an [interview with a genetic counseling trainee](http://www.ashg.org/education/newsletter/201708_leader.shtml), is out today!
