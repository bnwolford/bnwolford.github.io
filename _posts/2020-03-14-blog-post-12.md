This is your friendly neighborhood scientist asking you to **practice social distancing** if you have the privilege to do so!

It may feel like the world is in chaos. By my assessment, there is no need to panic. **However, there *is* a need to take the COVID-19 outbreak very seriously.** Epidemiologists and other health officials are currently advocating for important public health measures which are not a political ploy or a dramatic overreaction. Based on [history](https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7582), [peer-reviewed research](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa020/5735321), and the [trajectories](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case) of current outbreaks worldwide, we know it is very important that we ‘flatten the curve’ of COVID-19 cases in the United States. This means we slow the virus’ spread now so we won’t [overburden a health care system](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) with a finite number of ICU beds, ventilators, and health care professionals. You can read more [here](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help) and [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives). You can find scientists' advice about what social distancing might look like for you [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/). You can read the CDC's Community Mitigation Strategies [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).  

For a variety of reasons, many in society will be unable to practice social distancing adequately in the weeks to come. For example, certain professions such as caregivers and retail workers will need to continue daily operations. **If you have the ability to work from home and/or minimize interactions outside your immediate families, please do so now!** For many of us this means missing social gatherings or important events which we have planned for, spent money on, or looked forward to for some time. But, this also means we won’t be taking up health care resources for the more vulnerable among us. It also means we can play a role in stopping the exponential spread of the virus. You can learn more about the exponential spread of the virus [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg&app=desktop). And  [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) are some informative simulations to visualize the positive impact of social distancing.

Importantly, research is emerging that COVID-19 is being spread before carriers are symptomatic, meaning that it’s not enough to just stay home from activities if you aren’t feeling well. Read the [scientific pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1.full.pdf) or a [more accessible summary](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms). Although, as always, staying home when sick, washing your hands [properly](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), and not touching your face are important public health measures.  

It needs to be reiterated that COVID-19 is not the seasonal flu. The [summary](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130) of a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a 2.3% case fatality rate in COVID-19 cases through February 11, 2020. A [scientific pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104v1.full.pdf) attempting to adjust for a variety of data collection biases found an overall case fatality rate of 1.6%. Here is a [summary](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/07/coronavirus-age-specific-fatality-ratio-estimated-using-stan/) of that work and its limitations. While the estimates thus far are not perfect, the case fatality rate does seem to be higher than that of the [seasonal flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) which was 0.1% in the U.S. in 2018-2019. Populations with higher co-morbidities (e.g. obesity, smoking), an older population, or an overburdened health care system could see case fatality rates that are higher.  

Finally, it is also important to combat misinformation. Before sharing on social media, check the credentials of authors, potential biases of the sources, and the date of the news/posts to ascertain credibility. Memes are not credible. As a point of reference, I believe statements made by U.S. health care officials such as Dr. Tony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, or Dr. Francis Collins are likely to be trustworthy and measured. I cannot vouch for them all, but these [Twitter accounts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/03/14/coronavirus-the-most-essential-people-on-twitter-to-follow-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/#233ccf9275f3) may also be good sources of **scientific evidence**. The work by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) is also very thorough and the authors are up front about the limitations to their data analysis.  

I will be updating this with useful links in the days to come. Stay well and **practice social distancing**!

### March 16, 2020 Update  

Biostatisticians whom I trust to do solid science, including [Dr. Xihong Lin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/), have been working to analyze 25,000+ lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China. Their findings are in a [scientific pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1), summarized with this Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/XihongLin/status/1236075174069440512), and this [slidedeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tGJF9tdv4osPhY1-fswLcSlWZJ9zx45/view). 

In this study, scientists estimated R, the *effective reproductive number* of the virus. This is the measurement of transmission potential and is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case in a population where some people are susceptible and some are not (e.g. immunity due to previous COVID-19 infection). When R>1 the number of cases will increase and when R<1 the number of cases will decrease. From January 1-10 the R was 3.88. **Traffic bans, social distancing, and home quarantine brought R down to 1.25 by January 23-February 1.** But this is still not enough to cause a decrease in the number of new cases. **Centralized quaratine measures brought the R to 0.32 in the period after February 2.** This R value is less than 1 and indicates a decrease in cases. Centralized quaratine means suspected cases, close contacts of suspected cases, and cases who have tested positive are all quarantined in designated spots such as hotels. We need to be prepared for such containment strategies down the line and take immediate mitigation strategies seriously.

Statistical modelling estimates that 60% of infected cases are not ascertained, likely due to being asymptomatic. For example, 34.6% of positive cases on the Princess Cruise ship were asymptomatic. We need more way more COVID-19 testing in the U.S. Since we are woefully behind, it is even more imperative that **we stay home as much as posisble, even if we feel fine.** You are protecting vulnerable populations including the elederly and health care workers when you do so.
