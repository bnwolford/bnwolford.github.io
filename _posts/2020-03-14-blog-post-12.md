This is your friendly neighborhood scientist asking you to practice **social distancing** if you have the privilege to do so! 

It may feel like the world is in chaos, but there is no need to panic. However, there *is* a need to take the COVID-19 outbreak very seriously. Epidemiologists and other health officials are currently advocating for important public health measures which are not a political ploy or a dramatic overreaction. Based on [history](https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7582), [peer-reviewed research](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa020/5735321), and the [trajectories](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case) of current outbreaks worldwide, we know it is very important that we ‘flatten the curve’ of coronavirus cases in the United States. This means we slow the virus’ spread now so we won’t [overburden a health care system](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/) with a finite number of ICU beds, ventilators, and health care professionals. You can read more [here](https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help) and [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/13/815502262/flattening-a-pandemics-curve-why-staying-home-now-can-save-lives). You can find a scientists advice about what social distancing might look like for you [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-what-does-social-distancing-mean/607927/). You can read the CDC's Community Mitigation Strategies [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).  

For a variety of reasons, many in society will be unable to practice social distancing adequately in the weeks to come. For example, certain caretakers and workers will need to continue daily operations. **If you have the ability to work from home and/or minimize interactions outside your immediate families, please do so now!** For many of us this means missing social gatherings or important events which we have planned for, spent money on, or looked forward to for some time. But, this also means we won’t be taking up health care resources for the more vulnerable among us. It also means we can play a role in stopping the exponential spread of the virus. You can learn more about the expoential spread of the virus [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg&app=desktop).  

Importantly, research is emerging that COVID-19 is being spread before carriers are symptomatic, meaning that it’s not enough to just stay home from activities if you aren’t feeling well. Read the [scientific pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502v1.full.pdf) or a [more accesisble summary](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms). Although, as always, staying home when sick, washing your hands [properly](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), and not touching your face are important public health measures.  

COVID-19 is not the seasonal flu. One [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130) found a 2.3% case fatality rate. A [pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104v1.full.pdf) attempting to adjust for a variety of data collection biases found an overall case fatality rate of 1.6%. Here is a [summary](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/07/coronavirus-age-specific-fatality-ratio-estimated-using-stan/) of that work and it's limitations. While the estimates thus far are not perfect, the case fatality rate does seem to be higher than that of the [seasonal flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) which was 0.1% in the U.S. in 2018-2019. Populations with higher co-morbidities (e.g. obesity, smoking), an older population, or an overburdened health care system could see case fatality rates that are higher.  

Finally, it is also important to combat misinformation. Before sharing on social media, check the credentials of authors, potential biases of the sources, the date of the news/posts, to ascertain credibility. Memes are not credible. As a point of reference, I believe statements made by U.S. health care officials such as Dr. Tony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Brinx, or Dr. Francis Collins are likely to be trustworthy and measured. I cannot vouch for them all, but these [Twitter accounts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/03/14/coronavirus-the-most-essential-people-on-twitter-to-follow-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/#233ccf9275f3) may also be good sources of evidence. The work by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) is also very thorough and the authors are up front about the limitations to their data analysis.  

I will be updating this with useful links in the days to come. Stay well and **practice social distancing**!
