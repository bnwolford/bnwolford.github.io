I was honored to be highlighted by the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) at Univeristy of Michgan.  The [spotlight](https://michiganawis.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/awis-um-spotlight-brooke-wolford/) should you give a sense of my career trajectory (including life as a Natonal Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow), experiences as a woman in STEM, and my commitment to outreach. Please reach out to me bwolford at umich.edu if you'd like to further discuss life in academia as a woman!
