For the past 2 years I've contributed to the ASHG Trainee Newsletter, the Nascent Transcript. 2018's 4th quarter edition was published today, and includes my final contribution. I have greatly enjoyed interviewing trainees in the field, collaborating with other trainees through the editing process, flexing my science communication muscles, and curating #ASHGtrainee tweets. 

My [final piece](http://www.ashg.org/education/newsletter/201811_ASHG2018-Recap.shtml) is my favorite, and describes the latest research on polygenic risk scores presented at the American Society of Human Genetics 2018 Annual Meeting in October.
