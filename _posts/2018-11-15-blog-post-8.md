For the past 2 years I've contributed to the ASHG Trainee Newsletter, the Nascent Transcript. The 4th quarter edition was published today, and includes my final contribution. I have greatly enjoyed interviewing trainees in the field, flexing my science communication muscles, and curating #ASHGtrainee tweets.
