I had the privilege of interviewing [Natalie Telis](https://twitter.com/NatalieTelis) at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. We discussed the topic of her plenary talk, â€œScalable computational quantification of gender representation and behavior at ASHG." The [interview was published](http://www.ashg.org/education/newsletter/201711_leader.shtml) in the November 2017 ASHG trainee newsletter, the Nascent Transcript.
