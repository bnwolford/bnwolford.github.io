Last week was Computer Science Education Week, so naturally I wanted to highlight my favorte CS Ed organization, Girls Who Code at UM Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics! MiSciWriters, the awesome science communication blog at UM, published my [article](https://misciwriters.com/2018/12/10/girls-who-code-take-on-computer-science-education-week/) today. Our Executive Committee is really proud of the work we do here in Michigan and the materials we post on [Github](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB) for other CS educators! I'm thankful for the women I work with who do amazing research and serve their communities so well. Happy belated CS Education Week!
