I am available for K-12 science education in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area and in the Piedmont region of North Carolina (schedule permitting) free of charge. I have experience with public school classrooms, Science Olympiad teams, and Girl and Boy Scout Troops. I specialize in genetics and inheritance and will work with you to create a lesson that fits state and Common Core standards. If you are an educator in need of a science lesson to supplement your curriculum, please reach out. I'm making some of my educational resources available below with target audiences.
