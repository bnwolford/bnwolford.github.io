<a href="https://www.genome.gov/dna-day" target="_blank">National DNA Day</a> commemorates the successful completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA's double helix in 1953. Since many in-person DNA Day celebrations are moving online, I'm hosting this compilation of educational resources to celebrate Digital DNA Day: April 25, 2020.

## National Human Genome Research Institute
* <a href="https://www.genome.gov/dna-day/get-activity-ideas" target="_blank">DNA Day Activity Ideas</a>  
Start here!) Check out the HHMI Biointeractive resource on this page for middle and high school lesson plans in genetics, educational videos on genomics, and instructions on how to do DNA extraction from a strawberry. This link also includes video lessons from MIT on DNA, and more animated videos about the history of DNA discovery appropriate for middle and high school aged students. 
* <a href="https://www.genome.gov/dna-day/15-ways" target="_blank">15 Ways Genomics Influences Our World</a>  
Once students are more familiar with concepts surrounding genetics (see educational videos at the links above), explore real world examples on this website. These resources are geared towards high school students, or middle schoolers with a parent or sibling’s help. 
* <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/teaching-tools" target="_blank">Teaching Tools</a>  
(Start here!) Start with this resource, which covers thorough DNA lesson plans and instructions for making DNA origami, which can help students to visualize DNA structure. This link also includes lesson plans for transcription and translation and a history of genonomic. These resources are geared towards high school students, or middle schoolers with a parent or sibling’s help. 
* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOW5e4BgEa4" target="_blank">Lessons From the Human Genome Project</a>  
This YouTube video gives a brief history of the Human Genome Project and some of its applications. This is geared towards high school or middle school students.

## Genome Unlocking Life's Code
* <a href="https://unlockinglifescode.org/learn/curriculum" target="_blank">Curriculum</a>  
This link includes complete lesson plans for high school students exploring genetic variation and human identity. These were made to supplement normal high school instruction, and include both lessons and activities. 
* <a href="https://unlockinglifescode.org/media/animations/659#660" target="_blank">Animated Genome</a>  
(Start here!) These videos are animated introductions to what DNA is and would be a great introduction for high school and middle school students. The video runs pretty fast, so elementary students might want a parent or sibling present to help with reading. The animations are really fun! This link also includes videos on “Parts of the Cell” and “Chromosomes and Genes”. 
* Explore ethical, legal and social implications with <a href="https://unlockinglifescode.org/wdyt/#/" target="_blank">What do you think?</a>  
This link launches into an interactive website where high school and middle school students can explore ethical implications of DNA sequencing. This would be most useful after students have gotten a solid introduction to DNA and sequencing (see some of the above links). 
* Explore the human origins with <a href="https://unlockinglifescode.org/iaba/" target="_blank">In and Beyond Africa</a>  
This is another cool interactive website where students can explore different time periods and how human DNA has changed over time. This would be most useful for high school and middle school students after they’ve received an introduction to DNA and sequencing (see some of the above links)
* Strawberry DNA Extraction Experimen: Now that you’ve got a handle on what DNA is, extract some yourself with directors of the NIH and NHGRI! All you need is a few strawberries and some other everyday household items. This would be great for students of all ages, with a parent’s help!
