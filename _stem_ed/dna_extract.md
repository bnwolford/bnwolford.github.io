Through my <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com" target="_blank">Skype A Scientist</a> match in April 2021, I prepared materials for a Zoom session with a Cub Scout group of 1st-5th graders. We did DNA extraction from a strawberry, which exists in many forms on the internet. I tried to create an ingredient and equipment list that was as flexible as possible, so that parents wouldn't need to buy custom ingredients or equipment. The experiment needs some adults on hand, especially to read the instructions when on the lower range of elementary ages. A demonsration is optimal, and works fine virtually.
