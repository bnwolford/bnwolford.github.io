Led a computing workshop for Graduate Society of Black Engineers and Scientists (GBES) at UM to teach introduction to Python to my peers. Independently designed an interactive Python coding lesson available [here](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/codeDemos/blob/master/python_plotting_climate.ipynb) and taught on behalf of the Girls Who Code at UM DCM student organization.
