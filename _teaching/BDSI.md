I served as the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the Genomics group during the 2019 [Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI)](https://sph.umich.edu/bdsi/), an undergraduate research program in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and a Summer Institute in Biostatistics (SIBS) program. Undergraduate students from across the worrld were competitively chosen for this intensive six-week program of in-class instruction and hands-on research experience. As the Genomics group GSI, I worked with Biostatistics faculty to [mentor](https://github.com/bnwolford/BDSI) a group of sixteen students in broad introductions to the computational and statistical as aspects of genomics research including population genetics, polygenic risk scores, and scRNAseq. I then spent four weeks as a research mentor to four students working on an in-depth polygenic risk score project using UM's Genes for Good cohort.
