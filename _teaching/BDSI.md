I served as the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the Genomics group during the 2019 [Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI)](https://sph.umich.edu/bdsi/), an undergraduate research program in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and a Summer Instiitute in Biostatistics (SIBS) program. Undergraduate students from across the worrld were competitively chosen for this intensive six-week program of in-class instruction and hands-on research experience. As the Genomics group GSI I worked with Biostatistics faculty to [mentor](https://github.com/bnwolford/BDSI) a group of sixteen students in broad introductions to the computational and statistical as aspects of genomics research. I then served as a research mentor to four students on an in-depth polygenic risk score project involving UM's Genes for Good cohort.
