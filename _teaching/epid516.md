In Winter 2018 and 2019 I was a guest lecturer for UM School of Public Healthâ€™s Genetics in Epidemiology (EPID 516) course for Master's level students. I lectured on the topic of Functional Genomics and designed and facilitated a laboratory exercise integrating functional assays and public datasets on the UCSC Genome Browser.
