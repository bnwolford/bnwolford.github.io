In May 2019 I was a guest lecturer for a week-long PhD Course, [SMED8020](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/SMED8020#tab=omEmnet), in the [Department for Public Health and Nursing](http://www.ntnu.edu/ism) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu) (NTNU). I lectured on the topics of the Genetics of Complex Diseases, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and Functional Genomics. I developed a practical in which students performed a GWAS meta-analysis using METAL. I served as a grader for students' oral examinations.
