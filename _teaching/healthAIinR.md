On August 11-12, 2025 I will lead the inagural Health AI in R workshop at NTNU! This 1.5-day workshop is geared towards PhD students with beginning computational skills and an interest in AI for health research. Students will use the HUNT Cloud computational environment and learn to work with sensitive health data. We will focus on the use of the R, a free open source programming language used for data analytics and statistical analysis. Students will learn the basics of object-oriented programming, manipulating data frames, data visualization, and statistical learning. Detailed curriculum and learning outcomes are available on the course website. Limited travel grants are available through Digital Life Noway Research School. We will accept Master's students and Postdoctoral Fellows as space allows.
