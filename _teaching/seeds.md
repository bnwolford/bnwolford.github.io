In the summer of 2012 and 2013 I led Quaker Lake Campâ€™s Seeds Program, an environmental education program for preschoolers. I developed three hours of curriculum surrounding science themes including weather, metamorphosis, and astronomy for our weekly day-camps. I created a [blog](https://qlcseeds.wordpress.com) to document our learning experiences.
